# Fast-Reader Text Generator

A simple tool that jumbles text while keeping it readable by preserving the first few letters of each word.

## About Typoglycemia

Typoglycemia is a neologism describing the phenomenon where people can read words with scrambled letters as long as the first and last letters (or first few letters) remain in place. This demonstrates that our brain doesn't read every letter individually but recognizes words as whole patterns.

Example: "Aoccdrnig to rscheearch, it deosn't mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are..."
